# How-to for GROMACS/PLUMED installation and submission on CSCS Alps Daint
This is a short summary to compile your own GROMACS version on [CSCS Alps](https://www.cscs.ch/computers/alps). We will (hopefully) get access to the pool of ca. 2700 [NVIDIA Grace-Hopper](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/) (GH) nodes on Daint. Each GH chipset has 72 cores, 128GB RAM, and a H100 GPU with 96GB of memory. Keep in mind that these are massive nodes, as each one has four GH chipsets, in contrast to Piz-Daint, which feautured small nodes and good internode scaling. This has a few consequences
1. We cant (as for now) require just a fraction of a node. You have to require a full one, even if you plan to run only on one of the chipsets, and consequently will burn the full computational time you require even if you use only part of the machine.
2. The amount of cores and the GPU are overpowered for most unbiased MD simulations of small (<100k atoms) systems. It is very likely that in these cases the scaling is negative, with performance decreasing the moment you split the job on more than one chipset. For small sized jobs, or jobs with only one replica, baobab is still the best option.
3. As far as what we do now, it is highly unlikely that we will ever scale beyond one node, as the GH chipsets are so powerful that internode communication becomes a serius bottleneck. As such, countrary to Piz-Daint, most of our jobs here will be only single-node jobs.
